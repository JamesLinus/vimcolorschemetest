# Notes #

* Please be patient when you load these pages. They have a lot of iframes and so it can take some time to get them downloaded and rendered.

* Also, you want to use a modern browser like the latest version of Mozilla Firefox for best experience. I have tested these pages using Firefox version 3.5.

* To generated these pages, I used the TOhtml command in the Vim 7.2 distribution to generate the html files inside the iframes. The Perl script that I use to generate them is in the Subversion repository.

* I also maintain a similar project for GNU Emacs here.

* Color Themes

* The color schemes used in this page are available in the scripts section of www.vim.org.

* The actual color scheme files I used are available as local copies and are linked inside these pages for the record. Note that I may not have downloaded the most recent version of the color schemes available.

* Suggestions

* Please send me an email or open an issue. Thanks!

* Browse By File Type

* Featuring 428 schemes: * C * HTML * Java * Perl * LaTeX
